Monday, May 15th:
- Code written does pulse compression for us
- We can play around with windowing functions

The used signal is a "chirped" signal at 15mHz that sweeps through frequencies
- if there's noise in the middle of a chirp: chop it out, but we lose part of the original
signal. however, we can reconstruct part of the signal as well
- interpolating sampled parts of a signal


Airplane sends signal/pulse to ice sheet
Once it reaches the bottom of the ice cheet, it bounces back
- there's a bottom of the ice sheet at the "bottom" of the radargram


SNR - signal to noise ratio, starting point is 27dB (how much power is coming back from the ice sheet bed)
- SNR=20log(S/N)
    - N: standard deviation of NOISE
    - S: peak @ bed



- fast time: the time access for the pulse travelling down, reflecting, and coming back up to sonar
- slow time: real world time in which the plane is moving across the surface of the ice
y-axis: depth
x-axis: distance travelled

convolution: IFFT(FFT(Chirp)*FFT(-Chirp)) 
- provides sinc function


For measuring speed of light in ice, assume the dielectric constant for ice remains constant
