Monday, May 15th:
- Code written does pulse compression for us
- We can play around with windowing functions
- fast time: pulse? slow time: airplane
there's a bottom of the ice sheet at the "bottom" of the radargram

SNR - signal to noise ratio, starting point is 27dB (how much power is coming back from the ice sheet bed)
- SNR=20log(S/N)
    - N: standard deviation of NOISE
    - S: peak @ bed
